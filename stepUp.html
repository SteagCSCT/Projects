                        <p>STEP_UP is concept prototype that can be use to lift houses, those affected by flood..</p>

                        <p>The Project was done in the First Capacity Building Program, We selected our topic on
                            disaster management. </p>
                        <h5>Problem Statement</h5>

                        <p>Raghu is a farmer living in kuttanad, and his area is below the sea level. The biggest
                            problem that raghu faces is frequent flooding. He earns for his livelihood by farming.
                            He feels unsafe to stay his home, his house, crops, cattles all are at risk. The bank loans
                            are also a big problem for him. Even though the government promised all kind of support, the
                            need is still left empty-handed, no sought or technologies and weather forecast are
                            accessible.</p>
                        <p>
                            How may we help raghu find access to better information about natural disaster/ weather
                            changes?
                        </p>

                        <h5>Brainstroming</h5>

                        <p style="text-align: center;"> Solution Brainstroming </p>

                        <p>We sat with Dr Varghese Sir and shared our idea of Amphibious house. Then he suggested us to
                            work on the existing idea of lifting the concrete house making them smarter since our idea
                            is theoretically perfect but not feasible.
                        </p>

                        <p>Then we slightly changed our idea from Amphibious house to smart lifting mechanism of homes,
                        </p>

                        <p>We came up with many ideas of making the lifting system smart and safe</p>

                        <p>Firstly we tried to build an house later on we discussed with our mentors and decided not to
                            focus the prototype on building houses rather than on electronic circuits.

                        <p style="text-align: center;"> Using Tools </p>

                        <p>We utlized center workbench and tools to complete the prototype, we used playwoods to make
                            the model base.

                        <p>We celebrated onam at the center. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;"> Coding in progress </p>

                        <p>We used Arduino prototypig platform to build the electronics and used IMU sensor and
                            UltraSonic Distance sensor's to get level data.
                        </p>

                        <p>We are almost done 90 percent with our prototype. We just need to install the sensors. </p>

                        <p>We completed the prototype. </p>
